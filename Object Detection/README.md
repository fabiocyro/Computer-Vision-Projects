Here is a more advanced application with Computer Vision using Single Shot Multi Box Detection (SSD)

SSD have better results in comparison to other object detections libraries such as YOLO or Faster RCNN

The implementation is rather simple, just need to pay attention to some details!

The weights though could not be uploaded because they are too big, so you can get through this link:

This model runs better on GPU, such as CUDA.


I don't have GPU on my PC so I use CPU with small videos, the epic-horses.mp4 one with 10 seconds durations take around 5-10 minutes to process

On CUDA must be way faster obviously :)
